# Introduction
<br>
<p>
This is the frontend of our Recipe Site, we developed it in VueJS Framework
<i>an advanced javaScript framework used to build user interfaces</i>.
</p>
<p>
For the server side, we developed an API and worked with the site <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">spoonacular</a> to get information about recipes,
and we also used azure cloud SQL as our Database.
</p>

<p>
All of this information and more you can find in the About Page in our website.
